FACTIONS available in Fiery Void
notable technologies, special rules, differences from official version (if applicable)




GENERAL NOTES
-------------
Custom designs - some units are marked as "custom". This means they're not official designs released by AoG. This means they may not be evaluated as well as official ones, as well as they may not fit into the faction as originally designed.
	Before using custom units it's good practice to make sure that Your opponent allows that (and if You create a game with such units allowed - say so explicitly in game description!)
Unit enhancements - Fiery Void allows players to add enhancements to their ships (full list is available in separate file). Keep in mind that unit enhancements are originally optional rule, and enhancements may not be evaluated as well as base hulls (although they're generally pricy compared to their effect!). 
	Before using enhancements for more than rounding out remaining points it's good practice to make sure that Your opponent agrees with that (and if You create a game with enhancements allowed - say so explicitly in game description!).
	Note that some options listed as "Enhancements" are such only technically, as they're regularly available unit options (eg. fighter navigator). This is noted in enhancements list as well.
Fleet checker - tool that performs automatic check of fleet composition (using standard tournament rules). Game does not enforce its use, but these restrictions are aimed at creation of balanced and interesting fleets so it's encouraged :) . There are a few caveats to its workings:
	- non-standard restrictions are not checked (unit- or faction- specific requirements, allowances and restrictions - they're usually present in unit notes, for player to check (or not))
	- fighter variant restrictions are at flight level. This means that flight size does not matter, please do not abuse this. Secondly, official rules says fighter variant restrictions are of FLIGHTS per SQUADRONS (eg. uncommon - one flight per three squadrons). FV goes for straight one per three flights (this is a deliberate change). 
	- Fiery Void scales restrictions with fleet size (base rules have some restrictions flat aimed at 3500 level, eg. up to 3 ships on a given hull - this would have been ridiculous in 10000 points battle and hardly a limit at 2000)






AVAILABLE FACTIONS
------------------

ABBAI
Gravitic Shield - most Abbai units are equipped with Gravitic Shield. Active shield reduces both hit chance and damage of incoming fire. At range 0 fighters are assumed to be able to come close enough to ignore ship shields.
	Gravitic Shields are powered by separate generator, that can power up a limited number of them (usually not allowing a ship all-around protection unless generator output is boosted).
Quad Array - 4 separate weapons in a single housing that's prone to overheating. Using more than 2 shots can cause forced shutdown for a turn, to cool down. Number of shots is changed by using alternate firing modes. Defensive fire is always safe. (this is somewhat changed from tabletop arrangement, where a regular critical is rolled instead - with defensive fire too).
Comm Disruptor - weapon reducing target's EW and Initiative for next turn. 
Particle Impeder - purely defensive weapon, capable of intercepting weapons with "uninterceptable" trait (typically that means Lasers :) ).
	In tabletop, Impeder output can be boosted by channeling DEW - increasing intercept rating, acting as regular DEW (but only in Impeder arc) and reducing fighters' hit chance - effectively gaining interesting bonuses in Impeder arc as a tradeoff for leaving remaining arc with much reduced defenses.
	In Fiery Void this effect was difficult to achieve. It was changed to accept regular power instead (eg. it can be boosted similarly to other weapons), with boost giving similar properties as original DEW channel (increased intercept rating + reducing fighter hit chance). Ship Sensors output is reduced by 1 point, with appropriate extra power to play with instead.
	In effect, FV solution is more flexible (can boost Impeder without sacrificing protection in other arcs, can use power elsewhere), but weaker (in practice achievable boost is much lower, and requires forfeiting that point of EW), for hopefully similar overall power and playstyle.


ABBAI (WotCR)
Abbai fleet a few hundred years before the show era, representing Wars of the Centauri Republic period.
They have Gravitic Shielding much like modern Abbai (although much weaker), and weapons being precursors to modern Comm Disruptor (Comm Jammer and Sensor Spike).
Mine Launcher - weapon that can deploy mines during combat. Not implemented in FV, unit that has it (Motenai Mine Layer) is present in game but equipped with missile launchers instead.

BALOSIAN
No notable special systems/rules.


BRAKIRI
Gravitic Drive - adds a few perks to movement, notably being able to do all maneuvers even while pivoted/pivoting (they use thrusters appropriate for current orientation when pivoted). Also, Gravitic Thrusters ignore first "Efficiency Reduced" reduced critical, increasing their resistance to damage.
Corporations - Brakiri are split into competing corporations. On each unit it's noted which Corporation produces a given design (if not - it's assumed that all Corporations have equal access to it). This is irrelevant when fielding national Brakiri fleet, but You have option of fielding single Corporation as well. In this case, You have access only to that Corporation's designs (and common ones), but all restrictions (deployment & variant) are eased by one level. For Variant restrictions this means Rare->Uncommon->Common, for deployment Restricted(10%)->Limited->(33%)->Unlimited.
	Corporations have access to slightly different technologies and heave their own areas of specialisation, so their individual fleets are usually lacking in some area but have excellent access to something else.
	In-game checker does not take this rule into account.
Gravitic Shield - see ABBAI entry
Gravitic Bolt/Gravitic Pulsar - weapons that can have boosted output (damage and intercept rating), at the cost of (besides power) adverse effect if actually fired boosted - namely a cooldown period equal to boostlevel used. Additionally, if fired at maximum power, weapon can suffer critical damage.
Gravitic Shifter - weapon that rotates target, fired in special firing step before regular fire.
	Due to technical difficulties this weapon is NOT AVAILABLE in Fiery Void.
	Ships utilizing this weapon that were deemed important for faction (Tashkat, Tashkava and Shakara) are added as custom designs (Tashkaton, Tashkavaton and Shakaraton, respectively), with Gravitic Cannons in place of original Shifters.
Gravitic Mines - ballistic, hex-targeted weapon that can move units hit.
	Not implemented in FV.

CASCOR
Ionizer - Laser-based primary fighter weapon. Unlike more typical fighter weapons it's uninterceptable, but also cannot itself intercept.
Ion Field Generator - area-of effect weapon, targeted on a hex rather than ship. Units caught in area of effect have capabilities reduced next turn (reduced Initiative, Power, EW, OB, and has a chance to force shutdown a system).
Poor acceleration - for ships it's just that, very high acceleration cost. For fighters, it's double acceleration cost - but medium and lighter fighters have unusually high thrust ratings, too. In effect they can't accelerate very well, but are exceptionally maneuvrable even at high speed.
Ultralight fighters - smallest Cascor fighters are of Ultralight type, which allows them to efficiently fit into hangar space inended for larger fighters.
Tiqincc - medium Cascor fighters have tail gun. In tabletop, this gun has -2 penalty when fired together with main gun. In FV it does not.

CENTAURI
Ballistic Torpedo - in tabletop this weapon is able to target multiple units. In FV it's lacking this ability. Also, way to fire this weapon is very peculiar (You need to fire, THEN on the weapon itself indicate number of missiles launched).
Plasma Stream - weapon that permanently reduces armor of systems hit (in FV - every system hit, in tabletop - only those hit by full rakes). Also, counts full armor for every rake, despite Raking mode. 
Guardian Array - primarily defensive weapon that can intercept fire directed at third party, provided the weapon is between firing unit and it's target.
	In tabletop, it needs to be shut down to switch between offensive (antifighter) and defensive modes.
	There is no such requirement in Fiery Void, weapon can intercept or fire offensively at will.
	Also, definition of "between" was changed. In FV weapon is "between" firing unit and its target if bearing difference on them is at least 120 degrees (2 hexsides).



CENTAURI (WotCR)
Centauri fleet a few hundred years before the show era, representing Wars of the Centauri Republic period.
Sentinel Point Defense - Guardian Array precursor, with the same comments (except it doesn't have offensive mode available at all).


CH'LONAS (unofficial faction)
Based on design by Charles "Danesti" Haught, published in BabCom.
No very specific technologies - although they do have quite a lot of fancy weapons, they don't have individually atypical properties. 


CIVILIANS
Commonly available/generic civilian ships - or, if they're faction-specific civilians, they're noted as such in name.
No very specific technologies (or technologies specific to base faction).


CORILLANI
The Corillani are unusual in that they operate three independant navies, the Defenders of Corillan (DoC), the Corillani's People's Navy (CPN), and the Orillani Space Force (OSF).  Whilst these forces generally operate independently of one another they can, and will, fight alongside one another.  In practice, there is no restriction on mixing and matching ships from the three different sub-navies during fleet selection. However, when choosing fighters you must take the version of the Tillini which corresponds with the type of faction where hangar space is available i.e. DoC or OSF fighters could not be taken if the only hanger space available was on a CPN ship.
The OSF use the unique Plasma Projector weapon which focuses plasma into tight beam, resulting in a longer range than most plasma weapons and with lower damage degradation.  It deals damage similar to a heavy plasma cannon, however this is applied in raking (8) mode rather than standard mode as with most other plasma weapons.


CUSTOM SHIPS
Units that, for some reason, were not fit for any faction. 
Mostly a technical directory, not representing a playable faction.


DENETH
LCV Carrier - Deneth are the only official faction that have LCV carrier available, allowing these smallest ships to be fielded while conforming standard fleet composition rules. 


DESCARI
The Descari possess unique Plasma Bolter weapons which combine features from both plasma and bolter weapon types.  These weapons do a set damage amount and do not suffer the damage reduction typical in plasma weapons up to a set range (which varies depending on the type of Plasma Bolter used).  
Aside from this the Descari field a mixed of typical missile, laser, plasma and light particle weaponry.


DILGAR
Pentacan Formation (Inverted Wedge Formation in AoG Wars) - Dilgar ships can benefit from using Pentacan formation. In FV the rules for it have been altered (mostly simplified).
	Tabletop: Pentacan needs to be organized before battle begins (and there are strict requirements on number and size of ships in formation). Ships need to be within 10 hexes of Pentacan command ship to receive bonuses.
		Bonuses are:
		 - Initiative bonus provided by command ship (if any)
		 - All units in Pentacan use one Initiative roll (this part is optional)
	Fiery Void: only Initiative bonus is used (Initiative rolls are done in standard way, not "one for all"). Command bonus is applied to all ships within 10 hexes of command ship (not cumulative). Strict pentacans are not defined in any way. 		  
Fighter formation - As long as flight leader (first craft in flight) is alive and uninjured (eg. received no damage), flight has +1 Initiative.
Fighter pilot tenacity - Dilgar fighters have inherent -2 dropout bonus.
Mass Driver - many Dilgar ships have Mass Driver fitted. This weapon is functional in FV, but is intended as planetary bombardment weapon of mass destruction and has limited use in space combat (can engage starbases and imobile Enormous ships). It's a Matter weapon that automatically hits Structure. It can be intercepted without degradation (like ballistic weapons are).
Point Pulsar - dedicated weapon intended to make called shots - suffers only half of the regular penalty.


DRAKH
Custom fleet created by Wolfgang Lackner and Marcin Sawicki, based heavily upon BabCom-published designs by Roman Perner.
Middle-born - they're Middle-born faction, with civilization far older than even Minbari or Yolu. This has no direct impact on game, unless a particular system treats such a faction differently.
Shields - they have powerful shields, that can be boosted to be even stronger. They count double against Raking weapons. Cannot be flown under by fighters (unlike standard gravitic/EM shields). They don't decrease unit profile, only reduce damage (also unlike standard gravitic/EM shields). 
Advanced Armor - gives a plethora of perks, generally reducing damage taken. It reduces or limits special effects of most weapons that have them, and counts as 2 points stronger against ballistics. Ignored by weapons made by Ancients.
Gravitic Drive - see Brakiri.
Improved Sensors - halve effectiveness of enemy Jammer.
LCVs - Drakh LCVs use regular Sensors (that is, they're not bound by "all but 2 EW points need to be OEW" rule). 
Hangar space - Drakh LCVs do require hangar space (like regular LCVs). They share it with Drakh fighters, although LCVs take twice as many slots.


DRAZI
No very specific rules/technologies, although using alternate HCV layout is very notable and results in surprisingly resilient ships.


DRAZI (WotCR)
Drazi fleet a few hundred years before the show era, representing Wars of the Centauri Republic period.
No very specific rules/technologies.


EARTH ALLIANCE
Interceptor - dedicated defensive weapon. In tabletop, it needs to be shut down for a turn before switching between offensive (anti-fighter) and defensive (interception) modes. There is no such requirement in Fiery Void, weapon can intercept or fire offensively at will.
Energy Web - defensive system integrated with Interceptor. Active Interceptor provides (in its arc) shield-like effect of reducing hit chance of all incoming fire by its Intercept Rating. EWeb cannot be flown under by fighters, and does NOT provide damage reduction.
Shadow Omega - official Shadow Omega conversion by AoG is marked as unofficial because that's what official deployment restrictions sum up to (not tournament legal, opponent permission required). Actual fan-made conversions are present as well!


GAIM
Gaim are minor League race, but their ships are very good and their diversity is excellent - making them (in game, tactically ) in all respects equal to Big4 factions.
Notable technologies:
	Bulkheads - defensive system that can take damage first (after armor) when system is hit, which greatly increases resilience of Gaim systems. Bulkhead can protect systems on the same section, and structure it's mounted to (even if it's technically on different section, like on MCV). Note that PRIMARY systems are not protected by bulkheads. In FV decision whether to use bulkhead will be made automatically - Bulkheads will be used if they can prevent system destruction, when structure would be destroyed by the hit or when integrity of relevant Structure block remaining boxes fall too low. 
	Particle Concentrator - multiple Concentrators firing from the same hex may combine into one more powerful (and more accurate!) shot, a bit similar to what Ipsha Surge Cannons do. Its hit chance is average of all weapons concentrating (as they may be fitted on different ships, with different EW, their chances may differ).
		In tabletop it's more or less the same, except weapons within 1 hex can still participate and lock-on is denied if any participating weapon lacks lock-on.
		Kind of "known bug" - on MCVs/LCVs all Bulkheads can protect Structure against any shot, even coming from different direction (so eg. Aft bulkhead may kick in if a ship is attacked from front - though it will protect only Structure in this case)
	Packet Torpedo - ballistic weapon that has (besides range) a range penalty, just like direct fire weapons - with a twist that it kicks in only after first 10 hexes of travel.
		In tabletop target of this weapon is not known to opponent until impact (not implemented in FV).
	Scattergun - light weapon that fires random number of shots. When firing defensively (also random number of shots) those shots must be directed at separate threats.


GROME
The Grome a low-tech faction that prides itself in only using what they can build themselves. Their armament is made entirely of matter class weapons.
Notable technologies:
	Antiquated Sensors - These sensors cannot be boosted beyond their base state.
	Connection Struts - While Grome vessels have huge structure blocks, they are very fragile. If a connection strut is hit, the damage to the structure is doubled.
	Flak Cannons - This is key defensive weapon available to the Grome. It can only engage fighters, but scores damage in flash mode and the splash damage can damage anything. While effective in this role, the main ability is its defensive fire. It is capable of intercepting
		all fire from a single unit at -3 and suffers degredation like normal interception. Therefore three Flak Cannons can generate a -6 to hit from all fire from a single unit. In addition, the Flak Cannon can intercept for friendly units. As long as the friendly unit is 
		within 5 hexes and both the friendly and firing unit are in arc, it is able to engage. Lastly, the Flak Cannon can also intercept uninterceptable weapons like lasers. This is a little more effective in Fiery Void than on the table top.
	Light and Heavy Railguns - These are smaller and larger versions, respectively, of the standard railgun.
	Targeting Array - Currently, this system is being developed for Fiery Void. However, with are available and all other systems ready, the Grome are deploying with a modified version in Fiery Void. The Targeting Arrays are treated as 1 point Antiquated Sensors. This does 
		enable the Grome to improve their defensive abilities, but the overall trade-off enables the Grome to become a playable faction.


HURR
Low-tech faction. No very specific rules/technologies.


IPSHA
Baronies - there is no Ipsha "national fleet". Ipsha species is split into "Baronies" (separate feudal-like states), and fielded fleet belongs to one of them. Player may use only generic designs in use by all Baronies and designs specific to one chosen Barony (it's indicated in unit notes). Similarly, some enhancements are Barony-specific.
	In-game fleet checker does not take this rule into account.
	Some "baronization" of ships is available through unit enhancements (eg. You can apply typical Essan changes to basic Ipsha design).
Gravitic Drive - see Brakiri.
Mag-Gravitic Reactor - Ipsha power source has fixed power output, rather than default relative (eg. "Power rating of 40" rather than "enough to enable all systems on ship"). This implies that destruction of systems does NOT cut into power produced (Reactor outpus stays the same) - so even though Power is usually negative for a fresh ship (eg. can't power everything), number of possible enabled systems does NOT go down with damage.
Singularity Engine - Ipsha drive system is closely tied to Mag-Gravitic Reactor, which produces some quirks (notably Engine destructions destroyes the ship outright). This is not implemented in FV.
EM Hardened - Ipsha units are especially resistant to Electromagnetic damage. This is cumulative with dropout bonus their fighters possess. 
	Tabletop: Critical/drouputrolls caused by EM weapons are made with -2 bonus. In addition, this trait reduces effects of many EM weapons.
	Fiery Void: ALL critical/dropout rolls are made with -1 bonus. In addition, EM weapons treat EM Hardened units as they would ones with Advanced Armor.
Easy pivot - Ipsha ships have generally low pivot cost (even 0). Pivot-related penalties they suffer just like everyone else.
Cooldown - all Ipsha weapons have recharge rate of 1 (eg. can fire immediately after being powered up). However, they usually do require a cooldown period (eg. forced shutdown) after firing.
	Coupled with limited power available, this means Ipsha usually power up and fire some of their weapons, and while they are cooling down - rotate to bring freesh ones to bear.
Surge Cannon - primary Ipsha weapon is extremely versatile due to being able to fire more powerful beam in combination with other weapons. Basically two, three, four or even five weapons can combine into one shot with increased range, damage and fire control (against ships - against fighters more powerful shots are less accurate).
	To exercise this ability, just switch weapon to appropriate mode (2,3,4,5combined) and choose target. All weapons from the same ship sharing mode and target will combine into appropriate shot (or shots - eg. 4 weapons in 2combined mode would produce 2 shots).
	If indicated combination is not possible (eg. 3 weapons declared to fire in 4Combined mode) weapons will fire separately (in single fire mode) instead (usually missing, but not requiring cooldown).
	Each rake causes additional +2 on critical/dropout roll of system hit, too.
Spark Field - weapon creating a field that causes damage to all nearby units, friend or foe alike (non-cumulative). This damage is low but still threatening to fighters. Active weapon will cause effects (eg. "fire") automatically, player does not declare it beyond enabling and setting power level (in Initial phase).
Fancy weapons - many Ipsha weapons have complicated effects or modes of fire. Above are just most important/striking examples. Read weapon descriptions carefully.
Jumpsphere - Ipsha have only one official jump-capable ship, Scout Wheel. This limits their legal fleet builds for tournament/pickup battle. To allow greater flexibility in this area a plausible custom jumpship design was added, a Warsphere exchanging fighter hangar for a jump drive.


LLORT
No very specific rules/technologies.
It's worth noting that their ships are generally asymmetric and have atypical firing arcs and eclectic weapons sets.


MARKAB
Scattergun - see Gaim 


MINBARI
Jammer - Minbari units are equipped with possibly the most powerful piece of defensive technology in game. It prevents lock-on (which means range penalties against Jammer-protected units are always doubled) and halves ballistic weapons launch range. Minbari themselves ignore Jammer.
	Note that Jammer protection does not stack with jinking.
Gravitic Drive - see Brakiri
Antimatter Converter - weapon with theoretically infinite damage potential (no upper limit for damage dealt, it depends on how high can You make hit chance...). Does damage in Flash mode, so some damage is caused to other units on the same hex as target on a hit.
White Star - the mainstay of Army of Light is available on Minbari fleet list. It's difficult to handle, but in skilled hands extremely potent unit, equipped with technologies nominally beyond reach of Young races (Adaptive Armor, EM Shields, in case of Command variant - even self repair).
	These are not Minbari technologies (and are not available to Minbari as a whole, just this one ship).
	White Stars may be used as ISA/Army of Light/White Star Fleet as well. Such a fleet is NOT tournament legal, and for good reason - but may be interesting scenario piece (or challenge). It's way too nasty to be used in regular pickup battle! 
	When used in this way, only White Stars (and Combat Flyers they can carry, potentially) can be deployed, counting as Unlimited Deployment. Be warned - in skilled hands such a fleet is overwhelming. Playtesting suggests that fleet consisting fleet of 4 White Stars (nominally 3000PV) can fight as equal against 3400 points non-Minbari fleet tailored against them... just so You know ;) 
EM Shield - works exactly as Gravitic Shield does (see Abbai), but doesn't require a separate Generator. Shield emitter itself is self-sufficient.
Adaptive Armor - additional protection (increasing all armor ratings on ship or fighter) that is applied only to specific types of damage. Some points can be set at start of scenario (if ship design allows - White Star is not advanced enough) or after receiving damage from such a weapon in battle. Protection is limited both in total value and in value assigned to a particular kind of damage (in case of WS - up to 3 points can be allocated, but no more than 1 per damage type).
	In-game control allows easy propagation of setting among entire fleet (if other units can receive it of course). 
	Assigned points cannot be unassigned during battle.
	Tabletop: a single point is unlocked for every volley that actually causes damage.
	Fiery Void: a single point is unlocked for every "bit" of damage (a single system damaged by single subvolley), which may lead to easier unlocking of available protection (especially in case of Raking, Pulse or overkilling hits).
Self-repair - see Ancients.
Gravitic Net - weapon that moves target, fired before regular weapon declaration.
	This weapon is not implemented in Fiery Void, and ships equipped with it are not present either.
Electro-Pulse Gun - very short range, slow firing weapon that only affects fighters. However, it can make called shots at no penalty.


NARN
Energy Mine - hex-targeted weapon, causing heavy damage to everything on hex hit and lighter to everything on adjacent hexes. 
	Opponent does not see EMine target hexes (just the fact that they've been launched).
	Not 100% accurate - a launched mine may scatter or fizzle.
	Extremely disruptive to enemy fighters.
Pulsar Mine - higly automated short-range weapon that fires at passing fighters in Movement phase.
	In Fiery Void it is not implemented. Ships using it are also not present, bases have it replaced by other weapons.

	
ORIENI
Hunter-Killer - Orieni long-range weapon of choice, and probably their most outstanding feature. They're very large (fighter-sized) missiles, using fighter rules and attacking by ramming.
	They're automated, which means their parameters (primarily Initiative) are very poor for such small craft. But they're intended to engage capital ships, not other fighters.
	They're controlled by Hunter-Killer Control Nodes on Orieni ships. If there is no such control (or it's inadequate) HKs operate autonomously, which further limits their performance.
	Tabletop: flight is either controlled or not. Uncontrolled flights lose some Initiative and have limitations regarding thrust usage. Also, their hit chance is reduced. HKs start scenario in hangar, not launched.
	Fiery Void: control is exercised proportionally - eg. if there are 12 HKs on map and only 6 can be fully controlled, then all 12 receive half the penalties. There is very hefty Initiative penalty, but no other penalties. Also, HKs suffer additional Ini penalties during first 2 turns of the game (but start deployed like any other fighter).
	Hunter-Killers receive penalty to their hit chance based on their own speed (the faster the worse).
	Note that ramming attack happens before firing (in FV - in ship fire phase), so HKs that achieved ramming distance cannot be stopped before making attempt to ram.
Light Gatling Railgun - Orieni fighter gun is Matter, which allows it to be a threat to even the biggest ships. But bulky ammunition means it's limited to 6 salvoes before running dry.	
Strike Force - Orieni military is split into a few branches. Of interest for fleet composition rules is priority for the elite Strike Force - a few ships have different limitations when deployed as part of Strike Force detachment than when part of regular navy (Hand of the Blessed). Assume force led by Paragon to be Strike Force, while lesser command ships lead Hand of the Blessed.
	In-game checker does not take this rule into account.
	

RAIDERS
Pirates and privateers of Babylon 5 universe, both generic and faction-specific (the latter have appropriate faction/species as part of their name).
No very specific technologies (or technologies specific to base faction).


SMALL RACES
A few separate factions (both official and custom), connected only by the fact that they don't have many ship designs - as is fitting for such small organizations.
Belt Alliance is somewhat notable for extensive use of Matter weapons (including as fighter guns - see Orieni) and EA Interceptors (although with no integrated Energy Web).
BA also makes use of LCVs without a carrier for them, which they do not need being mostly intra-system force. This challenges their fleet when deploy under standard tournament/pickup battle limitations, unless rules are changed or allowances for Usuuth are made. 
Last but not least - Belters can use (are original designers and manufacturers, in fact) Delta-V fighters, available in Raiders directory (not Double-Vs though!).
Otherwise no very specific technologies.


SHADOWS
Ancient race, by definition complicated, very specific and not really on par with younger ones - tech difference is too high for proper balance. Ancient factions were officially not tournament legal.
But with these caveats - have fun! Ancients should be balanced against each other, and if Your opponent knows what to expect/You're playing a scenario, go ahead with other pairings as well. Note that sky-high individual cost of Ancient units makes standard requirements based on total fleet value completely inadequate (like number of units on a hull and number of required capital ships).
Below list of systems Shadows use, with short description of effect and design differences from original tabletop.
Called shots - systems on Shadow ships cannot be targeted by called shots.
Enhancements - Shadow ships use no crew, so cannot use rew-related enhancements. They can use enhancements relating to special officers (that would be ship pilot's skill in such case), and mechanical enhancements of ship systems (that would represent ship grown with special emphasis on some aspect). They have their own faction-specific enhancements as well.
	I have tried to block inappropriate enhancements, but if they show up on the list - bear in mind guidelines above :)
Self-Repair - automated, player cannot decide what is repaired. Damage suffered in current turn can be repaired, criticals can't. Cost of critical repair has been changed in places, and there's no partial repair of crits. See system description for details.
	If Self-Repair is destroyed or damaged, unused repair points are NOT lost.
Energy Diffuser - absorbs damage as it's being dealt (and diffuses it over time). In FV Diffuser always kicks in if possible, there's no option to withhold its use eg. waiting for more threatening damage and conserving resources. Diffuser in FV can dissipate damage just absorbed. For visual reasons tendrils are shown as separate (untargetable) systems. Damage absorbed by ship tendrils is not shown in log.
	Diffuser will not try to stop no-overkill damage that would kill system hit despite Diffuser interference. This is important for very strong Matter or Piercing shots.
	Flash damage is treated in a special way - portion of damage enough to destroy system hit is treated as entire shot (which allows systems to be saved even if total damage of shot is very high).
Bio-Drive - Shadow ships have omnidirectional thrusters that generate their own thrust. In FV, for technical reasons, there are also usual (untargetable) thrusters (with unlimited rating) and (also untargetable) engine (with rating being sum of biothruster ratings). Due to these technicalities thrust can be freely split, even from a single surviving biothruster.
	Biothrusters have their own set of criticals (basically output reduced) in place of regular thruster criticals.
	Bio-Drive cannot be boosted.
Pilot - Shadow ships have no crew, but they do have Pilot. Pilot is shown on ship window as C&C, and main differences from regular C&C are: Pilot cannot suffer criticals, but feels pain when ship is damaged (temporary) or when (s)he's wounded (as long as wounds remain). Pilot cannot be repaired by self-repair system.
	Telepathic attack on Shadow ships are not implemented.
Half Phasing - during movement phase Shadow ship can become semi-immaterial (until end of turn). It becomes much more difficult to hit (-4 penalty to incoming gunfire, -8 to ballistic fire) and less accurate itself (-10 to hit). Cannot ram or get rammed at all, unless both ships are half-phasing.
	Performing half-phasing costs full thrust from two undamaged BioThrusters (such BioThrusters must be present), as well as presence of undamaged (and enabled) Phasing Drive. Any damage to Phasing Drive during half-phasing destroys ship.
Ship layout - even capital-sized Shadow ships use MCV ship layout.
Shadow fighters - Shadow fighters are semi-autonomous slivers of their carriers. For this reason every Shadow fighter should take Uncontrolled enhancement (penalty for operating independently from carrier - for scenarios, really) or its carrier should take appropriate Fighter Launched enhancement (fighters are essentially part of carriers' Structure, and launch reduces that structure; this is the option to take in pickup battle). 
	Game will not force player to do so. Also, controlled/uncontrolled status cannot change during game (so carrier destruction will not affect fighters in any way).
	In tabletop, Shadow fighters cannot drop out. In FV they get a massive -100 dropout bonus instead - which means they'll pass all appropriate tests, but can be dropped out by weapons that explicitly cause such state without test. Note that most weapons that do so are Electromagnetic in nature, and therefore such effect is blocked by Advanced Armor. But technically some Ancient weapon causing such effect might force Shadow fighter to drop out. 
	To take advantage of their resilience (combination of Energy Diffuser protection and dropout immunity) Shadow fighters have their own algorithm for hit allocation (preferring spreading damage among the flight). 
	In tabletop fighters can be literally launched from their carrier - in FV that's not an option, as they have to start scenario deployed.
	Their weapon is an accelerator, able to build up charge - for this reason it will NOT be used for interception without explicit order to do so!
Battle Cruiser - this Primordial ship differs from modern quick-grown ones in a few ways, which mandated larger changes for FV:
	- most important is primary weapon firing arc: in tabletop it's split into large forward arc (120 degres) and smaller aft arc (60 degrees). In FV such a split is not possible, so aft firing arc is not present - Forward arc is widened to 180 degrees as compensation.
	- 6 separate Energy Diffusers would have been difficult to set up on PRIMARY in a clear way - therefore they've been moved to appropriate sides. This in turn affected hit table - each side's Diffusers have separate entry.
Destroyer - by original design should have acceleration cost of 1.5, which is not possible in FV (set to 2 instead).
Primordial variants - these are ships with Primordial and Additional Tendril enhancements added (neither of which is available in FV as actual enhancement).
Molecular Slicer Beam - primary weapon of larger Shadow ships has quite a few traits, some of which has been simplified for Fiery Void.
	First of all, it's uninterceptable - coupled with high FC and decent range it's quite accurate (as You'd expect from faction that uses small number of very potent weapons).
	Second, it ignores armor. Coupled with high damage output this means immense damage - at higher arming levels literally cutting ships apart, like on the show, is fully possible.
	Third, most powerful variety (Heavy, only found on Primordial ships - modern fast-grown ones don't get such power!) can use Piercing mode (in fact it's default mode for this weapon) - which CAN overkill (though only at full power), so its damage potential won't get wasted. Note that full power of the weapon will be appliet ONLY to Piercing shot (Raking damage is capped at 2-turns level)
	Fourth - Raking shot can be split into multiple smaller shots, which is very useful against fighters. Here come the differences:
	 - Tabletop: can fire at the same or different targets. FV: only one target for the weapon.
	 - Tabletop: any number of shots. FV: preset number of shots (3/6 for Light weapon, 3/6/9 for heavier ones)
	 - Tabletop: -1 penalty for every additional shot, cumulative. FV: ALL shots are penalized equally, at -1/-2/-3 appropriately.
	 - Tabletop: assign dice and parts of fixed damage. FV: for every shot roll (separately) full damage and divide by number of shots taken (round down).  
	 - Overall this means FV split fire is slightly weaker, slightly more accurate (on average; even much more accurate in case of large splits!), and less flexible (due to being unable to target multiple opponents simultaneously).
Phasing Pulse Cannon - Pulse weapons that completely ignore any kind of shield or shield-like defense (of younger races only). Note that EM shields (like those on White Star) are treated as Ancient even when used on Young ship.
Vortex Disruptor - weapon that destabilizes hyperspace vortexes, preventing enemy escape. As in FV there are no actual vortexes :) , weapon is purely scenario-related one - fired at hex where vortex opening is declared.
	Game will mechanically resolve the shot (eg. calculate hit chance and report result in firing log). 
	Hit chance will NOT be calculated when declaring.
	Semi-trivia: Vortex Disruptor will not function properly while half-phased (will be able to fire, but not hit). 


STREIB
A faction that has only one offically released ship (Collector), it was expanded a bit in BabCom by Paul Brown to create a playable faction.
Streib are notable for their extremely tough armor (without any special properties though) and extensive use of energy draining/dropout causing weapons. 
Layout of their ships is atypical as well - highly assymetrical, with many core systems placed on outer sections.
Their design makes them a bit Ancient-like when it comes to balancing - they are very vulnerable in some situations and unbeatable in others. In particular they are essentially shut down if their opponent is resistant to Electromagnetic weapons (eg. Advanced Armor or EM Hardening).


TORATA
Torata extensively use Accelerator weapons, either allowing them to fire faster at the price of decreased damage output (most ship weapons) or store double charge to be able to deal massive damage if fire is held for a turn (fighter weapons).
Accelerator weapons will NOT be used for interception without explicit order to do so - even fighter guns! Also, full-charge mode is specifically anti-ship (cannot be used vs fighters) - for this reason it's an actual alternate mode and will NOT be used without explicit order (You'll fire in basic mode by default).


USUUTH
No very specific rules or technologies.
Their fleet relies on LCVs but doesn't have a carrier for them (it's not needed when they operate within home system).
	This challenges Usuuth fleets when deploy under standard tournament/pickup battle limitations, unless rules are changed or allowances for Usuuth are made. 
	
	
YOLU
Light Molecular Disruptor - armor-stripping heavy fighter weapon.
Fusion Agitator - Raking weapon that does damage in inefficient Raking(6) mode. However, it ignores a point of armor (which helps), its raw damage output is decent, and if extra power is thrown in to boost it - damage output can rise to extremely high. Make no mistake: this is a very dangerous weapon! 
	Many Yolu weapons have special features, usually relating to target armor - see descriptions.
	

ZESCALATION CHOUKA (custom, alternate universe faction)
The Chouka Theocracy was a minor regional power in the Escalation Wars universe, and the Circasian's opponents in their first major interstellar war. The Chouka were more technologically advanced than the Circasians, but lacked the tactical experience and fleet assets to combat the more numerous and maneuverable Circasian fleet.
The ships included here are the Chouka spacecraft that served during the Chouka War period. They are armed with a mix of plasma and laser weapons, with older Chouka ships relying on plasma weapons while their newer ships rely on lasers in the anti-shipping role. Plasma weapons continued to be used for anti-fighter work into the Chouka War period, however.
As with the Circasians, the Chouka are best used against minor B5 powers (Alacans, Mitoc, Raiders), however some of their larger, more powerful units are roughly the equivalent of Dilgar-war era Earth Alliance. 
Point Plasma Guns - These short range plasma weapons are the Chouka's primary anti-fighter weapons.
Gravitic Tracting Rod - This rare device was only found on the Apostle Holy Cruiser. It was used to tractor on to smaller craft and draw them closer to dock with the ship for boarding. In Fiery Void, the Tracting Rod instead gives the target an initiative a thrust penalty.
Twin Laser Cannon - This Chouka weapon is an advancement over the basic Light Laser Cannon using early gravitic technology to improve its range. 
Light Energy Mine - This is a smaller version of the Energy Mine used by the Narn. It has shorter range (25 hexes) and does less damage (10/5) than the conventional Energy Mine. This weapon is being substituted for the Ballistic Mine Launchers these ships historically were deployed with.


ZESCALATION CHOUKA RAIDERS (custom, alternate universe faction)
This group of raiders operated in and around Chouka controlled territories and were directly financed by the Chouka Theocracy. They were an early threat to the Circasian Empire as it expanded its own sphere of influence. 
These raiders operate cast-off Chouka military and civilian ships and fighters. Their weapons are sourced from the Chouka, along with limited supplies from other black market sources.
Because of their ties to the Chouka government, these raiders are fairly well armed compared to the Circasian and Chouka fleets and are comparable to other low tech raiders in the B5 universe.


ZESCALATION CIRCASIAN (custom, alternate universe faction)
The Circasians are one of the two central powers in the Escalation Wars milieu. These Dilgar-like humanoids started as a small minor power surrounded by other, more established empires but through political manuevering and conquest they were able to eventually carve out a major imperium of their own.
The ships included here are low tech units the Circasians used during the Chouka War period. These vessels are principally armed with light particle, plasma, and laser weapons. Anything more powerful is beyond their level of technology at the start of the war.
They are capable opponents against the minor B5 powers (Alacans, Hurr, Usuuth) but will be completely overwhelmed by more capable units.
Rockets - the Circasians made use of these primitive torpedo launchers on their early ships. These weapons are treated like Torpedoes and benefit from OEW.
Particle Lance - an avenue of advanced R&D before the war, this weapon was an attempt to develop a heavier version of the Light Particle Cannon. Like the Gravitic Lance, this weapon is capable of firing as one more powerful weapon or as two weaker Light Particle Cannons.
Particle Gun - an even weaker version of the Light Particle Beam that was used before that weapon was developed.
The Circasian faction was created by Tyrel Lohr for his Escalation Wars setting.
Fiery Void encoding done in collaboration with Geoffrey Stano.


ZNEXUS BRIXADII (custom, alternate universe faction)
The Brixadii Clans are a spinward power within the Nexus sector, having fought with the Dalithorn Commonwealth early on and having hostile relations with the Velrax Republic. The Brixadii's 
technology is primarily focused around particle weapons. These are rugged, easy to repair, and low mass. This last point is important as the key feature that defines the Clans are their extremely
maneuverable ships. They have few longer-ranged weapons, but prefer high-speed firing passes or getting in close and using maneuverability to get advantageous shots. They do not field fighters and
therefore rely on their rapid firing weapons, wide arcs, and light combat vessels to deal with fighters. The Brixadii have their basic designs for their earliest tech levels, which are fairly low tech.
The Brixadii are part of the Nexus Universe setting and are designed by Jeremy and Geoffrey Stano.
If You want interesting low tech faction then by all means use it, just be warned :)
Chaff Launcher - technically fired at enemy ship, it will always hit (causing no damage or adverse effects) and apply interception to ALL fire from target hex at chaff-protected unit (including nominally uninterceptable weapons).
Nexus LCVs - Unlike the Babylon 5 powers, the Nexus powers focused more effort on their LCVs. As such, LCVs can be deployed independently and field Antiquated Sensors. This allows them to use EW 
without any restrictions, but they cannot boost their sensors.

ZPLAYTEST DALITHORN  (custom, alternate universe faction)
The Dalithorn Commonwealth are likely the lowest tech of the main Nexus powers. They managed to leverage their position across a major trade route to keep their sovereignty up to the later years of
the First War of Control in the 2150s. They primarily use terrestrial weapons converted for use in space combat. While individually weak, many of the weapons are treated as matter weapons, allowing
the Dalithorn to cause some damage. Also, while simple, a number of their weapons are still effective, such as the gas gun. The Commonwealth does not use fighters in the traditional sense. They only
field super-heavy fighters, but these are typically slow. However, their size and armament allow them to serve as area of denial platforms against enemy fighters or as serviceable anti-ship units.
The Dalithorn are part of the Nexus Universe setting and are designed by Geoffrey and Jeremy Stano.
At this stage, this low tech faction is in a playtest state. Their art is just a fancy silhouette and they need some matches played to ensure that their capabilities and points are accurate. Fiery
Void currently has their basic, early units.
Protector - Given their ships were already using a variety of ammunition-based weapons, necessitating the primary cargo bay, the Dalithorn had no issue creating a flak-style system to defend their ships.
Although not designed to engage targets, the Protector is capable of intercepting any weapon, including lasers, and intercepting for a friendly unit as long as the friendly unit is in arc and 3 hexs and
the firing ship is in arc. 
Nexus LCVs - Unlike the Babylon 5 powers, the Nexus powers focused more effort on their LCVs. As such, LCVs can be deployed independently and field Antiquated Sensors. This allows them to use EW 
without any restrictions, but they cannot boost their sensors.

ZPLAYTEST VELRAX  (custom, alternate universe faction)
The Velrax Republic is potentially the most aggressive, but not necessarily the most militarisitic faction within the Nexus setting. They have engaged both the Brixadii Clans and Dalithorn Commonwealth
several times. In the chaos of the First War of Control, they did managed to conquer must of Dalithorn space. Unlike the Brixadii and Dalithorn, the Velrax are heavy fighter users and this plays into
a rigid fleet structure. The Velrax field well armed "strike" carriers supported by anti-ship focused "gunships". Everything revolves around supporting their fighter operations. The carriers utilize plasma
waves to break up enemy forces at range, and gunships with lasers to single out anti-fighter units. Also, the Velrax carry plasma arcs, which are smaller versions of the plasma stream. These are used to strip armor to
make their weapons more effective, including the light fighter guns. Their heavy fighter mounts a potent anti-ship gun that was retrofitted to some of the interceptor fighters when they realized that
their opponents did not use fighters to the degree they did.
At this stage, this low tech faction is in a playtest state. Their art is just a fancy silhouette and they need some matches played to ensure that their capabilities and points are accurate. Fiery
Void currently has their basic, early units.
Plasma Arc - Small, raking plasma weapon that is designed to strip armor from their target.
Dart/Streak Interceptors - These are small torpedoes that can accept OEW and used to engage enemy fighters.
Laser Spear - A precursor to the laser lances the Velrax eventually field.
Nexus LCVs - Unlike the Babylon 5 powers, the Nexus powers focused more effort on their LCVs. As such, LCVs can be deployed independently and field Antiquated Sensors. This allows them to use EW 
without any restrictions, but they cannot boost their sensors.
	
ZSTARWARS (custom, alternate universe faction)
Star Wars units, as designed by Wolfgang Lackner-Warton and Marcin Sawicki.
We tried to make it playable against B5 fleets as well.
Due to nature of StarWars universe, essentially any faction can use almost any unit. Primary users are indicated in notes though.
It's assumed that - for fleet design purposes - fighters do require hangars (even if they're hyperdrive equipped). It's also assumed that any fighter can use any hangar, taking more or less space - therefore small craft are grouped into "Fighter squadrons" and "Assault squadrons", and appropriately limited (with superheavy fighter squadron and light fighter squadron requiring the same hangar space, but the latter being composed of far more craft).
	Fleet checker does properly account for SW small craft.
We portrayed weapons to allow long range of fire, but for the fire to be wildly inaccurate. Hence Pulse mode with very low base number of hits. This allowed to keep very high weapon count of SW units manageable (they're grouped into batteries that are firing as single weapons in FV)
Based on visuals and effects in movies - we call SW Laser/Turbolaser weapons to be Particle class, with all consequences.
We portrayed SW units as quite durable for their size, and that durability is boosted by shields. Shields are difficult to take out, too (projectors have high HP count and low hit table profile). Shields have a number of exceptions to their protection based on how we see them to work (notably increased effectiveness vs Raking weapons, while SWIon, Ballistic and Matter weapons just bypass them).
StarWars Sensors are portrayed to be generally of lower tech than B5 ones. This is portrayed by generally low output and limited boostability (notably ElInt boostability is not reduced though). However, LCV do have full-blown sensors, without B5 LCV Sensors limitations. 

	
	
	



POWER RATINGS
-------------
Below is completely subjective grouping of factions by power rating. Factions from the same bracket share some characteristics, which in most cases means they should be well-matched for a competitive pickup play (which doesn't mean perfect!). In a few cases I took liberty to highlight a particular build as a separate ‘faction’.
Note that evaluation (just like point values) assumes standard conditions (default-sized fixed map, basically) – changing conditions throws it away.


EASY AND FORGIVING
Factions that are particularly easy to fly, and recommended for new players. Use these factions for Your first set of battles – You will fight interface and opponent, let Your ships make that a bit easier for You! When You feel that period is over and want to expand – be advised to still avoid factions marked as particularly difficult.
Drazi (their jack-of-all-trades ships are very flexible and can unleash full power against any oponent, while their layout makes them surprisingly resistant to damage).
Narn (very tough and with powerful weapons – they may not be fancy, but they get the job done and refuse to die even if put in unfavorable position; average in most other aspects, which gives good feeling of what You want from Your units and allows informed choices for expanding Your picks)
EA (extremely tough, with awesome defenses and good firepower – balanced by difficulties with firepower concentration and low maneuvrability. Their resilience makes them very forgiving to any mistakes a beginner may make)
  

FIRST LEAGUE
This is default Big4 power level in show era – what I consider to be the ‘baseline’ of competitive play. Smaller factions may fit here due to their raw power, but usually won’t allow flexibility of fleet design offered by major factions.
Brakiri
Centauri
Dilgar
Drakh (although, being Middleborn rather than Young race, they exhibit some traits similar to Ancients – not enough to kick them to Ancients grouping though)
Drazi
EA (barring Warlock)
Gaim
Llort
Minbari (warning: Jammer is very daunting, expecially to new players – it’s easy to feel overwhelmed; at the same time flying Minbari is not easy either. It’s advised to stay away from them on either side of the table until You feel You have solid command of the game)
Narn (barring massed EMines)
Orieni (this one is tricky – will usually feel superior against average player due to raw damage output of Hunter-Killers and massed RGRs, while remaining vulnerable against sharp handling by expert oponent; if You don’t consider Yourself an expert, be advised to treat Orieni as a Superior faction)
Torata 


SECOND LEAGUE
Factions that point for point will have uphill battle against First League, yet otherwise are balanced and competitive. Should be interesting to play against each other, and if given some extra PV allowance – against First League as well. Most of these factions do not offer fleet build flexibility of major factions, but may offer a very distinct handling/playstyle instead.
Abbai
Balosian
Belt Alliance (Small Races)
Cascor
Centauri (WotCR)
Ch’Lonas
Deneth
Descari
Drazi (WotCR)
Ipsha
Markab
Raiders (note plethora of background-driven options – Raiders often use a hodgepodge of units and formal FV fleet selection rules don’t always do them justice!)
Star Wars (custom faction with VERY different playstyle - consider them difficult to fly!)


THE REST
Factions that cannot seriously compete. Usually they have some deficiencies that cannot be fixed by simply increasing their PV allowance (like combination of poor maneuvrability/poor Sensors/short range weapons on low-tech ships or some glaring weakness in overall fleet layout).
Abbai (WotCR)
Alacan (Small Races)
Brixadii
Chouka
Chouka Raiders
Circasian
Dalithorn
Grome
Hurr
Rogolon (Small Races)
Sorithian (Small Races)
Usuuth
Velrax


SUPERIOR
Factions that, point for point, usually beat First League. That may be due to overall superior value or some special side effect of their rules, so simply allowing opponent extra PV might not be enough to balance things.
EA using Warlock
ISA (eg. all-White Star fleet - note that it's difficult to fly, too!)
Narn using massed EMines 
Yolu


ANCIENTS
Factions that can’t really be balanced vs Young Races. Overall high power and durability and selective ignoring enemy systems (especially defensive ones – which hurts some opponents while leaving others untouched) coupled with small numer of shots and relative vulnerability to swarms are impossible to properly balance for pickup battle. For these reasons Ancients got their own category.
Shadows
Streib (actually a Young race, but their ship design and technology is peculiar enough for them to feel surprisingly Ancient-like when it comes to balancing: some opponents are easily overwhelmed (especially those that rely on mass of individually light shots), while others are overwhelming themselves (especially if they’re resistant to EM weapons or have high quantity of armor-ignoring weapons). Streib are definitely NOT up to fighting actual Ancients though! )
