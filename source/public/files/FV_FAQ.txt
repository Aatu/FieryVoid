FIERY VOID
This is browser game intended to be as close as possible to Babylon 5 Wars tabletop game, by Agents of Gaming (bowing heads to You, AoG!). 
Therefore, there is no game manual for FV itself - as all rules are readily available under the name Advent of Galactic Wars, available at B5Wars Vault (see Links section!). If You know these rules, You should essentially be able to play Fiery Void (after coming to grips with the interface :) ).
For new players - the game is quite large (as manual size can attest), but don't worry. A lot of that size is just a list of available weapons and other ship systems for the game, and in FV computer handles mechanical side of things - You can start with only the basics and go deeper step by step, at Your speed. If You don't know the game, I suggest simply asking for a tutorial from more experienced players - if You post such request on Facebook group I'm sure You'll find a volunteer to explains basics to You. 
If You have any doubts, ask there as well.


Below is list of differences from B5Wars mechanics and known bugs that aren't expected to be fixed soon.


USEFUL TRIVIA
 - W - show EW in graphical form.
 - X - show friendly EW in graphical form.
 - Y - show enemy EW in graphical form.
 - F - show friednly ballistc fire in graphical form.
 - E - show enemy ballistic fire in graphical form.
 - In addition, you can display Hex Numbers for scenario planning by clicking the button marked '#'.
 - If you have ship that shouldn't be there any longer (e.g. has left map) or just crippled and useless, you may simply get rid of it so it doesn't bog down your game. In Initial phase, set its Reactor to overload and it will self-destruct at the end of the turn.
 - r-click on unit - select the unit (if it's Yours) and bring its control window up.
 - r-click on weapon - select all similar weapons on this unit (e.g. to fire all guns in fighter flight, or all Twin Arrays on a Centauri cruiser...)
 - r-click on power button - power on/off on all similar systems on this unit
 - r-click mode change - change firing mode on all similar UNDECLARED weapons
 - r-click on defensive fire - enable defensive fire on all similar UNDECLARED weapons
 - r-click on cancel move button - cancels entire current batch of moves for indicated unit
 - r-click on cancel firing order button - cancels firing orders on all similar weapons on this unit
 - r-click on move forward button - move forward using all remaining movement

GAMEPLAY GENERAL IDEAS
 - As much as possible was automated. This means that player has somewhat less control over things he does, but things are far more streamlined for computer game. This is especially visible in firing (you'll see in details).
 - There is no separate Power and EW phase. They're combined into a single Init phase, which happens after Initiative roll.
 - Deployment: player may deploy anywhere in pre-designated DZ, with any direction  of movement and speed between 0 and 10.  You can also select to add Asteroids to be randomy placed in the playable area (see below for Terrain rules).
 - Fixed map: the game allows displaying the boundaries of a fixed, rectangular map. It does not, however, enforce anything about it. It's up to the player for the ships leaving the map to actually behave as disengaged. 
 - Game does not enforce fleet design rules. We try to include necessary information into ship window, however, so player may do it without using outside source.
 - Fleet design rules may be checked automatically using appropriate button at design stage. Note that the check is not perfect, especially faction- or unit-specific rules are not taken into account. Rules were modified to allow scalability, too. 
 - Game was changed from d20 to d100 (displayed as percentages usually). Most values are now displayed as percentages (1 point on d20 equals 5%).
 - Rounding is done for d100 now, too, not d20. So -1/3 weapon (-1.65/hex, by FV numbers) at 1 hex range would get ~2% penalty (~4% with no lock on), instead of B5Wars' 1 and 2 respectively (which would have translated to 5 and 10 %)


MOVEMENT
 - Snap turn: it's implemented as consecutive but still separate turns. Turn delay is taken from first one only (so if You wan to shorten snap turn, shorten its first segment). This means even thrust allocation is checked for each hex side separately, not for combined turn.
 - Fighters don't get auto-return from pivot.
 - Turn into pivot does not stop pivoting itself.


ELECTRONIC WARFARE
 - CCEW: Provides a lock on ALL enemy fighters within 10 hexes.
 - Most activities requiring multiple EW points can be done with fractions. E.g. Blanket DEW (1 per 4 points allocated): You may allocate , say, 3 points and get 0.75 points of blanked DEW (around 4%).
 - Disruption EW: ALL target locks are affected equally, by appropriate fraction of power used. E.g. if You use 1 point of DIST and target has 3 locks up, each one of these would be reduced by 0.33 points.
 - Disruption EW: CCEW is treated as one OEW target and affected appropriately.
 - Disruption EW: target locks weaker than 1 point but worth at least half a point provide half-lock (e.g.ange penalties multiplied by 1.5 instead of being doubled).
 - Only own DEW can bring profile below 0: this rule is not respected in FV.


FIRING AND WEAPONS
 - Firing order of weapons: Each weapon has priority number which determines order of firing, the exception is Ramming attacks which always happen first and may destroy other ships/weapons before they are able to fire). Player cannot influence it. It was tried to optimize effectiveness of weapons, but as in B5Wars every player prefers different firing pattern (and also it's influenced by a particular target).
 - Choosing target section: it's done automatically, based on algorithm that takes into account target section profile and remaining boxes of structure. Weapons from the same ship CANNOT be split between multiple sections even if they overlap. Shot into open PRIMARY will not be picked if there is any alternative. 
 - Choosing target system: it's done randomly out of eligible targets if there are multiple ones. UPDATE 13.09.2021: in-arc systems will be hit before off-arc ones (assumes that direction of damage comes from shot, which may be occasionally incorrect (e.g. for Flash collateral damage)). 
 - Choosing target fighter: there is algorithm that tries to minimize damage done. However, it operates on expected damage instead of actual, and won't take into account most special effects.
 - You can target individual fighters (just target any of its systems). This will be treated as a called shot.
 - Fighter dropouts are done together with critical hits (so AFTER firing at ships, not before)
 - Interception is handled automatically (with algorithm that tries to intercept most powerful shots first). 
 - Weapons firing every turn are automatically in interception mode if not declared otherwise. 
 - Slower-firing weapons You need to manually put in that mode if You want them used for interception. 
 - There is no Ballistics firing subphase. Instead ballistic weapon impact is done in other subphases as appropriate (ship fire, fighters fire at fighters, fighters fire at ships).
 - Fighters can intercept ballistics fired at ship, but they must start and end their movement in that unit's hex except in turn 1 (where they can't start on the same hex).
 - Multi-shot weapons can choose only one target when firing offensively (Twin/Quad Arrays, Heavy Arrays...).  Certain notable exceptions have been added to date, including for Ballistic Torpedoes and Shadow Slicers.
 - Power and missile launches are simultaneous in FV - so disabling Jammer cannot affect missile launch on current turn. Instead, it will affect missile launch on NEXT turn!
 - Multi-mode weapons, switched at power on in B5Wars: simplified and can use any mode at will (Interceptor, Guardian Array).
 - Piercing attacks have quirky way of finding whether damage should be split into 2 or 3 parts - essentially split to 2 if shot enters and exits through the same section.
  -- in some situations entering and exiting part might be applied to the same section! (possible if said section spans 180 degrees or more - it's facing both entrance and exit path in such case).
 - Piercing damage vs MCVs is reduced by 10% (instead of -2/die).
 - Piercing attacks can be made without special requirements regarding EW - appropriate penalty is always included in fire control. 
 - Relative position of units on the same hex is not correctly resolved if units start turn on the same hex. As a compensation for this, all targets at range 0 are considered valid for ballistics launch.
 - mode used is always visible in FV. This means, among other things, that opponent immediately knows what kind of missile is launched (in tabletop only a few special missiles disclosed that information before attack phase).


DELAYED DEPLOYMENT
- Fleets and Ships have the option to delay after Turn 1 during Game Creation and Fleet Selection.
- You can select this option in two ways: 
	1) In Create Game screen, set 'Turn Available' field to the desired deployment turn for the Player Slot you want to deploy later, all ships will deploy on that turn by default,  
	2) In Fleet Selection screen, when purchasing individual ships, choose a new value in the 'Deployment' option.  This can be combined with the Player Slot option to deploy later than other ships in the Slot.
- Ships that have not deployed yet will have a hex marker showing where and when they will appear, enemies will not be able to see this marker.  You can right click on this hex to see late-deploying ship's SCS in case you forget what's deploying there.
- Ships which would normally have to set systems on Turn 1 and choose to deploy later e.g. Hyach Specialists, Vorlon Adaptive Armor, will set these systems on the turn they deploy.
- IMPORTANT - If a player's entire fleet is not deployed yet, they will still have to click through Initial Orders and Firing Phase to progress the game.
- NOTE - Terrain, Bases and OSATS cannot deploy later in the game and will always deploy on Turn 1.

 
TERRAIN
- ASTEROIDS - You can choose to add Asteroids as terrain in the Create Game menu.  A number of asteroids will be randomly placed across the game space at the start of the game. Alternatively, you can also add them manually from the Civilians faction for specific scenarios.
- Terrain blocks line of sight between units, and will damage any non-fighter units that move through them during the Movement Phase (Note - This damage is applied at the end of the turn, with other firing and counts as a Ramming attack).  In addition, like all Enormous units they may fully ram any ships with end their movement on the same hex as them (see below).
- MOONS - Similar to Asteroids, except they take up multiple hexes instead of just one.  Any unit moving into a moons area will also automatically crash into it (e.g. ram) during the Firing Phase, instead of just taking collision damage as it passed through.


STEALTH SHIPS
- Stealth ships are impossible to detect at long ranges, and will be invisible to enemy player(s) until they reveal themselves or are detected.
- A stealth ship is revealed if it uses any EW ability other than Defensive EW (DEW) during Initial Orders, or fires any of its weapons.
- Stealth ships can also be detected at the start of the Firing Phase if they move into an enemy unit’s detection range and it has active sensors/line of sight.  These ranges are as follows: Base (5x Sensor Rating), ELINT Ship (3x Sensor Rating), Other Ship (2x Sensor Rating), Fighter (Offensive Bonus).
- ELINT ships can further boost their detection range by investing EW points in 'Detect Stealth' ability, which increases their detection range by +2 per EW point spent.
- Once detected, stealth ships will remain visible, but can become hidden again if they break line of sight with all enemy ships at the end of a turn (and don't otherwise reveal themselves by firing a weapon).
- If a stealth ship's scanner or computer system is destroyed it's defence profile will be increased by 15% for the remainder of the battle (represented by criticals on its CnC)
- Stealth systems also provide a Jammer ability (e.g. always double range penalty as if no-lock).  Against ships this applies to other ships targeting from over 12 hexes away (over 4 hexes for fighters, 24 for bases).  Stealth fighters get this no-lock bonus against all enemy fire from over 5 hexes away, and additionally ballistic launches cannot be made against them from more than 5 hexes away.
- Note, Stealth fighters cannot become invisible in the same way as stealth ships, and only benefit from the jammer/no-lock abilities.


OTHER
 - Jump Drive: usually it can't be turned off for power unless seriously damaged, but there are scenarios that allow just that. So the game does not force it and it's up to the player to decide whether or not it's allowed.
 - Enormous units: some units in game are Enormous. They are recognized as such, but some rules are NOT implemented. Enormous units block line of sight if any part of a potential shot would pass through any part of the hex they are in.  Ships that end their movement on the same hex as Enormous unit WILL automatically make a ramming attempt, fighters are exempt (in tabletop they would have made Skin Dance roll - with high chance of success, and additional bonuses if they succeed; here there are no additional bonuses but they can safely enter Enormous unit's hex.
 Different damage dealing from Energy Mine, targeting from Mass Driver or power from Improved Reactor also take Enormous size into account.
