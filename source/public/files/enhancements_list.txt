UNIT ENHANCEMENTS AVAILABLE IN FIERY VOID
Unit enhancements are in general pointed quite high - but it's not always the case. Sometimes they can be a bargain - eg. Sensor boost for low-tech battleship.
For pickup battles - I suggest remembering they're optional, and using them requires opponent agreement. A single enhancement to round out points is probably fine, but if You want to seriously enhance Your fleet - check with opponent if that's acceptable.
Their main intent is to be scenario option, or a campaign tool where they can represent units accumulating experience.

NOTE: some FV enhancements represent regular unit options rather than proper enhancements. Fighter Navigator is good example, as well as variable missile loads.
