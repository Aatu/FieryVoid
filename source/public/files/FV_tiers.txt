FACTIONS available in Fiery Void split into more or less cohesive groups ("Tiers").
Factions from the same bracket should be well-matched for a competitive pickup play (which doesn't mean perfect! - also, see Tier descriptions).
This list is completely UNOFFICIAL and SUBJECTIVE. In a few cases I took liberty to highlight a particular build as a separate 'faction', too.
This evaluation (just like point values) assumes standard conditions (default-sized fixed map, basically) - in different conditions (say, open map) different factors become important and balance changes.


EASY AND FORGIVING
Factions that are particularly easy to fly, recommended for new players. Use these factions for Your first set of battles - You will fight interface and opponent, let Your ships make that a bit easier for You! 
 - Drazi (their jack-of-all-trades ships are very flexible and can unleash full power against any oponent, while their layout makes them retain combat value even after sustaining heavy damage)
 - Narn (very tough and with powerful weapons - they may not be fancy, but they get the job done and refuse to die even if put in unfavorable position; average in most other aspects, which gives good feeling of what You want from Your units and allows informed choices for expanding Your picks)
 - EA (extremely tough, with awesome defenses and good firepower - balanced by difficulties with firepower concentration and low maneuvrability. Their resilience makes them very forgiving to any mistakes a beginner may make)

Tier Ancients
Ancient factions aren't well balanced, but their capabilities are broadly within range of each other, so they can be played competitively (more or less). They tend to have very high firepower, very high durability, and a lot of special rules - also, they do ignore most of Young factions special rules.
Their volume of fire tends to be low, which causes trouble when facing massed opponent (eg. a fighter-heavy fleet).
 - Mindriders
 - Shadows
 - Thirdspace
 - Vorlons

Tier 1 - High Performance Competitive 
This is default power level of show era major factions ('Big 4') - mor eor less the 'baseline' of competitive play. Smaller factions may fit here due to their raw power, but usually won't allow flexibility of fleet design offered by major factions.
 - Centauri
 - Dilgar
 - Drakh (custom faction; being Middleborn rather than Young race, they exhibit some traits similar to Ancients - not enough to kick them to Ancients grouping though, they are balanced vs Tier 1 Young factions)
 - Drazi
 - EA (barring Warlock and Shadow Omega)
 - Gaim
 - Hyach	
 - Kor-Lyan (note very heavy use of ballistics)
 - Llort
 - Minbari (warning: Jammer is very daunting, expecially to new players - it's easy to feel overwhelmed; at the same time flying Minbari is not easy either. Not recommended (on either side of the table) until You feel You have solid command of the game!)
 - Minbari Protectorate (while lacking Jammers, they still field quite capable units, but their fleet selection is limited)
 - Narn (barring massed EMines; opinions about what 'massed' means vary, but let's call 6 launchers as upper limit acceptable for Tier 1 - just to have an explicit borderline)
 - Orieni (very tricky - may feel superior due to raw damage output of Hunter-Killers and massed RGRs, while remaining vulnerable against sharp handling by expert oponent)
 - Torata 
 - Vree (warning: their high resilence coupled with all-around, accurate firepower is very daunting!)
 - Yolu (custom-repointed ones; basically official Yolu with enhancement that modifies their point value, making them more balanced)


Tier 2 - Medium Performance Competitive
Factions that point for point will have uphill battle against Tier 1, yet otherwise are balanced and competitive. Many of them have weaknesses more pronounced than acceptable for Tier 1, too. Should be interesting to play against each other, and if given some extra PV allowance - possibly against Tier 1 as well. Most of these factions do not offer fleet build flexibility of major ones, but may offer very distinct playstyle instead.
 - Abbai
 - Balosian
 - Belt Alliance
 - Brakiri
 - Cascor (Custom - basically official Cascor with enhancement that modifies their point value, making them more competitive)
 - Ch'Lonas (custom faction)
 - Corillani
 - Deneth
 - Descari
 - Drazi (WotCR)
 - Escalation Chouka (custom faction - Escalation Wars universe)
 - Escalation Circasian (custom faction - Escalation Wars universe)
 - Escalation Kastan (custom faction - Escalation Wars universe)
 - Escalation Sshel'ath (custom faction - Escalation Wars universe)
 - Pak'ma'ra
 - Raiders (note plethora of background-driven options - Raiders often use a hodgepodge of units and formal FV fleet selection rules don't always do them justice!)
 - Rogolon (Small races)
 - Usuuth (Small races)
 - Star Trek (TOS) Federation  (custom faction - Star Trek universe)
 - Star Wars (custom faction (or rather factions), Star Wars universe - with VERY different playstyle, consider them difficult to fly!)
 - ZBSG COlonials


Tier 3 - Low Performance Competitive
Factions that point for point will have uphill battle against Tier 2, and quite often have glaring holes in their capabilities that can easily be exploited by more advanced opponent. Yet - they can be competitive against each other, and can offer an interesting change of pace compared to more capable factions.
 - Abbai Matriarchate (WotCR)
 - Cascor Commonwealth (official)
 - Centauri Republic (WotCR)
 - EA (early)
 - Grome
 - Hurr
 - Ipsha Baronies
 - Markab Theocracy
 - ZEscalation Blood Sword Raiders  (custom faction - Escalation Wars universe)
 - ZNexus Brixadii Clans (custom faction - Nexus universe)
 - ZNexus Craytan Union (custom faction - Nexus universe)
 - ZNexus Dalithorn Commonwealth (custom faction - Nexus universe)
 - ZNexus Makar Federation (custom faction - Nexus universe)
 - ZNexus Sal-bez Coalition (custom faction - Nexus universe)
 - ZNexus Velrax Republic (custom faction - Nexus universe)
 - ZStarTrek Federation (early) (custom faction - Star Trek universe)
 - ZStarTrek Suliban (early) (custom faction - Star Trek universe)


Not Balanced
Factions that are not suitable for competitive play, for various reasons. Too weak, too powerful, with performance varying wildly depending on opponents' capabilities, or just with too narrow fleet selection - they are there to be used in scenarios, campaigns, and to fill out the universe.
 - Alacan (Small Races)
 - EA using Warlock or Shadow Omega
 - ISA (eg. all-White Star fleet - note that it's difficult to fly, too!)
 - Narn using massed EMines 
 - Sorithian (Small Races)
 - Streib (custom faction; their ship design and technology is peculiar enough for them to feel surprisingly Ancient-like when it comes to balancing. Streib are definitely NOT up to fighting actual Ancients though!)
 - Yolu (official)
