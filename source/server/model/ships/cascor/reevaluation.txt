CUSTOM reevaluation of Cascor
by myself (Zero_1627) with second opinions of a few others; forum consensus seems to be that Cascor ships are too pricy in general, though.


My take is that players in general find Cascor underperforming. I think that's because while their interceptors are very good, their strike fighters are abysmal - and their ships seriously overpriced. IMO fixing that price has a good chance of fixing the faction.
WHen done by the way of enhancements - we'd have fully official Cascor in game, but also an option to take them as custom faction with different prices. I hope it would be appealing to many players - and should net us one more competitive Tier 2 faction at little effort.

To that end, I'd like to get a second opinion about prices proposed ðŸ™‚ . In general most Cascor ships do look nice (besides being horribly costly), with low to medium level of firepower (but fast-firing long range guns, which counts), but also combining lowish durability with very large profiles, making them easy targets.
Also, in line with faction idea, they can generally maneuver decently for their size, but have major problems changing speed - so are essentially forced to remain at the same speed all game, cannt perform quick bursts of acceleration.

Qoccata Supercarrier: 950-> 875   (me 825, Wolfgang 875-900)
Very large carriers do tend to be very pricy, so I'm wary of cutting her down too much! Still - that's one big TARGET ðŸ™‚ 

Coquari Scout: 750->650 (me 600, Wolfgang 700)
750 is Covran bracket... which Coquari definitely isn't.  Defensively 5 Doal Ion Bolters isn't out of line of average scouts, offensively four Ion Field Generators are a lot of fun (and some control effects) but actually little in the way of firepower. 
I took Sho'Kar (575) as comparision - she has the same Sensors and lacks offensive firepower, but is also smaller AND better defended, which counts for a lot in scout (so it can actually perform its function without dying immediately). Va'Kar (650) actually has some offensive firepower and is pricier - but also even more elusive and maneuvrable.

Norsca BC: 700->625   (me 625, Wolfgang 650)
Not a bad ship, as far as Cascor go ðŸ™‚ - but with all the drawbacks of Cascor (low firepower, easy target). I cut it down to G'Quan points level and hope she'll perform adequately.

Norscator Gunship: 825->650   (me 585, Wolfgang 700-725)
Actually, I have no idea why it's officially considered more valuable than Norsca. Technically has slightly more firepower (Ionic Laser offers a token better damage output than Ion Cannon), but at double the range penalty - and loses torpedoes as well. Gains Aft guns, which is of little utility in a ship that needs to get close to opponent to actually do something. Loses half the fighter capacity to do so, too. Also, has no extra tools to actually survive closing with opponent...
Overall I consider her to be a downgrade to base Norsca, and set point value accordingly.

Nesacc Explorer: 700->650   (me "same as Norsca", Wolfgang 650-675)
well, she's an explorer, not a strictly combat ship, so maybe that 700 is explained by economic cost... I'm still tempted to cut her down at least a bit; I'm keeping official line of "the same as Norsca" ðŸ™‚ .

Quoricc DD: 500->425   (me 400, Wolfgang 450)
Nice firepower and carrier capacity... but short ranged, woefully vulnerable AND with low thrust to boot (that last point actually unexpected for Cascor ship...).
Overall - a brawler that can't close to brawling range on its own, and can't survive if it does either.
The closest analog I can find is Dilgar Abrithi (400) - actually Abrithi seems even worse - but it's also a scenario piece technically (an assault ship). 

Drocca Torpedo Destroyer: 600->540 (me 500, Wolfgang 550, Douglas 550-575)
When armed with long-range ballistic weapons, Quoricc drawbacks actually aren't much exposed, so that's a lot of value gained right there. Nice fire support unit. Uncommon, so can't take more than one without a few of actual Quoricc, though!

Crocti Patrol Carrier: 420->400
What can I say, a small (by Cascor standard) carrier that's semi-combat capable. Actually her price isn't unreasonable, considering she has token long range guns too...

Tacacci Strike Frigate: 440->420 (me 420, Wolfgang "no more than a token down")
She can almost hold her own as is. As a medium ship that can stay at range and reach, she offers surprisingly good staying power, and lack of acceleration is a secondary consideration.

Talacca Frigate Leader: 500->480 (me 475, Wolfgang "no more than a token down")
a straight (and meaningful) upgrade of Tacacci, what's not to like? I cut her down by a token only as well.

Calaq Assault Fighter: 60->45 (me 45, Wolfgang 55 but add upgrade as well)
She has a weapon that can reliably engage ships from outside of CCEW range... and a whole lot of drawbacks. Technically a heavy fighter, she's more fragile than half the Mediums around - but all other stats are proper for a large Heavy... her light weapon is a single one as well (rather than the usual twin mount), and with heavy one being Exclusive it's not really anything more than (poor) attempt at self defense. SHe retains poor Cascor acceleration, too, despite having overall low thrust...
...Actually Sitara seems to be overall better despite having no light weapon at all!!! I cut the price down to Sitara level, this way she becomes just costly for what she can do...

Caltus Torpedo Fighter: 65->40 (me 42, Wolfgang 45 but add upgrade as well)
All the drawbacks of Calaq (actually profile is even bigger), and it needs to pay extra to have any useful weapons... at least Navigator is included. Currently, fully loaded Caltus costs 113 points... and that's WAY too high price for 3 torpedo salvoes (once torpedoes are launched her remaining weapons aren't much worth mentioning). 
Phalan-M costs 35 points even with full price paid for Navigator, and it's very costly for what it does... Caltus at least has twin launchers AND longer ranged ordnance, which counts - but still I cut the base price to lower than Calaq...

Tiquincc is fine (especially with boosted Aft weapon it's nice superiority fighter, actually offers at least some staying power too), and so is Caccar (pricy, but VERY difficult to catch - a harasser straight from hell).
I feel no need to touch fixed structures either (the osat actually looks cheap, as a surprise).

Tiqus Attack fighter: CUSTOM Tiquincc variant for attack fighter role.
Idea description:
My proposal (instead of upgrading existing fighters) is to add a new fighter: attack variant of Tiquincc. Traits:
 - Uncommon variant
 - forward weapon switched to reasonably powerful antiship weapon
 - proposed weapon: more powerful (say, about Frazi level) (but NOT longer ranged) variant of Ionizer, dual mount but firing every other turn (and exclusive weapon) - probably with penalty vs fighters.
 - Aft weapon stays, as defensive one
Intent: this fighter will retain Tiquincc drawbacks (large profile, flimsy) and be poor as interceptor (front guns would be probably decent vs superheavy fightrs though ðŸ™‚ , otherwise single Aft gun will be the weapon of choice).
Against ships, Cascor agility plus 1/2turns weapon will mean it will make precision passes coming from weakly defended aspects, and its weapon should allow these passes to do reasonable damage - but its flimsiness would mean it cannot force its way, relying instead on harassing fighters (which Cascor should have plenty) to put cracks into targets' defensive coverage. WIll need to be escorted, but it should not be a problem for Cascor.


*****************************************************************************************************
Similarly, in December 2024 Yolu got reevaluated (generally upwards), to make them a more even match for Tier 1 fleets:
 Initial comments:

Yuan Dreadnought 2100 -> 2400 (VERY powerful ship, and so diffucult to evaluate; I'm comparing to Shargoti: Yuan has more capital firepower, but less brawling firepower, as well as smaller hangar - and crucially no Jammer)
Ulana Patrol Cruiser 1200 -> 1360 (Hyflite: 1355)  (absolutely devastating anti-capital firepower, with limited brawling/AF options; closest equivalent would be Bin'Tak, I think, but Ulana is flat more powerful)
   Udran Command Cruiser 1375 -> 1650 (retains anti-capital firepower of Ulana while also boasting of powerful brawling/AF suite and a token hangar - overall a much more dangerous and flexible ship; Maybe not quite Warlock level, but not far off... and Warlock seems to be underpointed... I place her near Warlock/Sharlin in points)
Aluin Gunship 1100 -> 1400 (Hyflite: 1350) (very similar to Ulana... except even more antiship firepower, and a bit less antifighter capability - one ship fleet as long as You can keep enemy ships away... I'd say "a bit more than Ulana", it's less flexible but has more raw power)
Notali Carrier 1000 -> 1150 (Hyflite: 1130) (still powerful antiship but not quite Ulana level, more AF than Ulana - and fighters of course; not so much durability though) 
Nashana Light Cruiser 950 -> 1150 (very balanced - with solid primary antiship long range battery backed up by quite a lot of Fusion Cannons (including Heavy ones), and a token hangar too; not that far below Ulana, really; that would be my favorite)
Notai Assault Carrier 950 -> 950 (shouldn't it be Notali variant? yes it should, correcting! and correcting hangar space as well) no fighter hangar and no long range firepower (short range anti-capital guns are there in numbers though :)) - overall notably less valuable than Notali due to lack of range)
Maltra Scout 900 -> 1000 (Hyflite: 970) (Maltra is much more durable and is a viable close combatant/capital escort in her own right, I'd price that high - closest comparision is Leshath, with a point more EW and Jammer and more guns... but it's 1500 points; still, Jammer is especially useful for a scout, so I wouldn't price Maltra THAT high ðŸ™‚ ) 
Hastan Escort Frigate 800 -> 800 (excellent ship, though overshadowed by Maitau - perhaps reevaluation will make her more appealing; EA Cronos is also officially 800 points, has more heavy guns - and her lesser durability and EW is aided by EWeb; I'd leave her as is for starters actually)

Maitau Pursuit Frigate 600 -> 800 (Hyflite: 785) (at 600 points she's WAY too cheap - not agile, but Medium status, high durability, cruiser's main battery coupled with solid Fusion Cannons for defense and brawling... at 600 it was "ram as many of them as You can before thinking anything else", and it worked!)
   Maishan Strike Frigate 710 -> 750  (vastly more short/medium range firepower than Maitau, at the price of no long range guns; excellent ship, but it was so far overshadowed by Maitau - reversing price difference should make her much more appealing)
   Malau Attack Frigate 625 -> 650 (basically Maitau but without range - definitely the least capable of the three, probably because she predates other variants by a hundred years ðŸ™‚ )

Utan Heavy Fighters 110 -> 95 (Hyflite: 86) (excellent at killing ships, which Yolu fleet generally need no help at - slow, but well armored and powerful; I think 110 may be too much, but at Tzymm's price level I feel it would become too powerful (...like Tzymm itself ðŸ˜‰ )
Yonor Breaching Pods 50 -> 50 (even more durable than usual for BPs, so a bit pricier seems fine)
Nathor Assault Shuttles 40 -> 75 (actually as durable as breaching pods, and with good weapon! - they should be priced accordingly, at 40 points they're actually viable as assault fighters...) 

As declared previously, I'd like to add another unit to the order of battle:
Utanor Heavy Interceptor (85 points?) - (Common variant of Utan, differences: light gun double->triple mount, no heavy gun, OB 5->6, Thrust 8->10)
