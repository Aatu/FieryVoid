purchase individual shells individually. To do this, I am assuming that each railgun is
equipped with 2 of the most expensive shells (heavies). Most shells are cheaper, but using
heavies ensures a realatively fair cost as a player is unlikely to use a standard shell 
on one of these "full" units. The final point total will be adjusted to be divisible by 5.
The costs before rounding the final value are: 
			Heavy railgun ~36 points
			Railgun ~24 points
			Light railgun ~12 points
