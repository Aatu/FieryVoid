This file contains guidelines to assigning weapons resolution priority.

General remarks:
 - it is desirable that priority of firing at fighters is different than priority of firing at ships
 - it is not implemented (yet) though
 - so weapon priority should be appropriate for anti-ship fire (unless weapon is capable of anti-fighter fire ONLY)!
 - priority should be in 1-10 range
 - if weapon causes multiple but otherwise separate hits, single hit should be considered when assigning priority (example: Pulse hit is the same as a few separate hits of power comparable to single pulse)
  - damage mode as well as special properties should be taken into consideration (eg. armor-ignoring weapons should in general go late, as should Raking weapons)
  
Ship weapon priority:
1: mostly special weapons that should be fired ASAP (eg. area-affecting weapons) (eg. AM Converter, EMine)
2: special weapons requiring to be fired early, but not so much as priority 1 (eg. Plasma Stream or Piercing weapons)
3: very light weapons (average damage 8 and less) (eg. Scatter Pulsar, Ligh Pulse Cannon)
4: light weapons (average damage less than 12) (eg. Light/Standard Particle Beam, Medium Pulse Cannon)
5: medium weapons (average damage less than 14) (eg. Light Bolter)
6: heavy weapons (average damage 14 and more)(eg. Medium Bolter, Fusion Cannon, Heavy Pulse Cannon...)
7: large Raking weapons (average damage output >28) (eg. Heavy Laser, Battle Laser...)
8: non-large Raking weapons (average damage output <=28) (eg. Medium Laser and lighter)
9: Matter weapons (note: light matter weapons may often be treated just as light weapons instead!(GatlingRailgun)!) (example: Matter Cannon, Railgun)
10: mostly special weapons that affect systems hit and therefore should be fired late (as their effects are none if hit systems are later destroyed) (eg. Burst Beam)


Fighter weapon priority:
1-2: mostly special weapons that should be fired ASAP
3: light fighterweapons (d6+2 and weaker)
4: typical fighter weapons (d6+3 - d6+4, also 2d6 and d3+5)
5: large fighter weapons (d6+5, d6+6, fighter missiles)
6: very large fighter weapons - Standard mode (Ion Bolt, Gatling Pulse Cannon)
7: skipped due to antiship->antifighter translation peculiarities!
8: (heavy) Raking fighter weapons
9: fighter Matter weapons (heavy ones!)
10: mostly special weapons that should be fired late


Anti-fighter priority: can be set by creator if desired. Default algorithm will leave 1,2,10 in place (as weapons that should have special position in firing order), and will try to order others with heavy hitters going first: so first Raking, then heavy Standard, then Matter, then remaining ones in reverse order.
